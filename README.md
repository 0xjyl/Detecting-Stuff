## Detection Queries

### CrowdStrike Query Language (CQL) Queries
Custom by me

Community created (various sources)

### Splunk Query Language (SPL) Queries
Custom by me

Community created (various sources)

### Misc ??? Queries 
Some niche tools have custom query languages, I'll try to source these and put them here for a central reference. I've also used niche tools like Netography, Corelight, Sublime, etc that all have their own query language.

## Detection Scripts
Mostly custom atomics that aren't parsed and are a PITA to remove the test cases. Don't duplicate work just use these.

## Manual Detections 
For the niche use-cases like validating detection rules that require specific parent processes or a specific detection chain

## Detection Research 
For the random projects/techniques I have been researching.
